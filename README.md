## Ollama Chat App

This Python application leverages the power of Ollama large language models (LLMs) to create a dynamic and engaging chat experience. Users can interact with various Ollama models directly from the interface, providing a fun and informative way to explore their capabilities.

### Requirements

* **Python 3.7 or later**
* **Streamlit:** Install using `pip install streamlit`
* **Ollama:** Follow installation instructions from the official Ollama repository: [https://github.com/ollama/ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) ([https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama))

**Optional (for local development):**

* **Ollama Server:** If you prefer running Ollama locally, set up a server instance according to the Ollama documentation. Alternatively, you can provide a remote server URL in the `BACKEND_URL` variable.

### Usage

1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Install dependencies:** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming you have a `requirements.txt` file listing the necessary packages).
3. **(Optional) Configure Ollama server:** If using a local Ollama server, ensure it's running. Otherwise, update the `BACKEND_URL` variable in the code with your remote server's address.
4. **Run the application:** Execute `streamlit run chat-app-ollama.py`.
### Features

* **Model Selection:** Choose from a variety of Ollama models using the sidebar dropdown.
* **Streaming:** Select between streaming responses (real-time updates as the model generates text) or non-streaming (displays the complete response after processing).
* **Chat Interface:** Enter messages in the chat input box and receive responses from the chosen Ollama model.

### Customization

* You can add more Ollama models to the `model` list in the code.
* Consider incorporating error handling for potential API issues or unexpected responses.
* Enhance the visual design using Streamlit's layout and styling options.

### Further Development

* Explore integrating with other Ollama functionalities beyond chat.
* Implement user authentication for personalized interactions.
* Build a more robust server-side component if needed for scalability or security.
